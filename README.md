Spotify Dashboard
Why This Dashboard?
Spotify's music analysts, playlist curators, and marketing teams were drowning in spreadsheets. They needed a quick way to spot trends, compare artists, and figure out what's actually working in the charts.
This Power BI dashboard solves that problem.
What It Does
Overview Page

Key metrics at a glance: Total songs, artists, average popularity, and song duration
Content breakdown: See how explicit vs clean songs perform
Album analysis: Singles vs full albums - what's charting?
Time trends: Monthly and yearly patterns in popularity and new releases
Top performers: Quick view of chart-topping songs and artists

Artist Page

Artist rankings by popularity and chart performance
Deep dive capability: Click any artist to see their full catalog, release dates, and performance metrics
Hit makers identified: Find artists with the most #1 positions and consistent chart presence

Songs Page

Song rankings across all metrics
Release strategy insights: Single vs album track performance
Detailed records: Everything you need - release dates, artist collaborations, popularity scores, chart positions, and duration stats

The Problem It Solved
Before this dashboard, the team had to:

Manually dig through CSV files to find basic stats
Guess at trends without visual confirmation
Struggle to compare explicit vs non-explicit content performance
Miss connections between artist strategies and chart success

Now they can answer questions like "Should we promote more singles or album tracks?" or "Which artists consistently hit #1?" in seconds, not hours.
